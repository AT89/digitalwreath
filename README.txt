 Christmas Wreath with over 700 transformed elements (I know... just trying some ideas). Hue rotated + randomly distributed lights. Sparkle throughout. Subtle animation on each ring, because it needed a little dose of trippy.
Trying to warm your heart... but likely will warm your hands if you're holding your device.
